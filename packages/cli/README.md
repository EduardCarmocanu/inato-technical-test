# CLI

This package is the beginning of a CLI built using [commander.js](https://github.com/tj/commander.js).

You can run it using the following command:
```sh
pnpm start
```
Or, if you are at the root of the repository
```sh
pnpm cli start
```

If your API server is running and available on port 8080, it will display "pong".
